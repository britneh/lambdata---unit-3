``` 

Britne, your code is very clear and easy to follow. 

Your Flowers class in the flowers.py file is simple and concise, super nice. 

I think you might have duplicative files here: build/lib/britneh_lambdata and here: britneh_lambdata and 
I'm not sure you need both.

Great job! You get a 3!!!!!
